Based on chapter II, explain what the writer means by ‘the electricity lifestyle’, ‘the Web lifestyle’, and ‘the Web work-style’. Illustrate with the most important elements of each style, according to the book.

The electricity lifestyle is explained with a brilliant example in this book.
It represents the impact of the internet. For example, if you asked your
friends whether they use internet, it would be a valid question, but if you
asked them if they adopted "the electricity lifestyle", they would think you're insane.
People nowadays don't think much about their electrical products, we just use them.

It's taken more than a hundred years for the electricity lifestyle to revolutionize
civilization.
But our grandparents and other people in our lives, remember the times when only
a few families had TVs.
The main use of electricity was for lighting, it's capacity to change people's
lifestyles was still hidden.
Now, the Internet is a communication infrastructure that completely depends on
electricity, and it is said that its popular acceptance is an extension of the
electricity lifestyle.

But now, the Internet is enabling us a new way of life that Bill called "the Web lifestyle".
It's just like the electricity lifestyle, it is characterized by new things
that are evolving rather quickly. And we're already there.

Intelligent machines, like PCs are becoming more powerful and less expensive, and 
since they are programmable, they are used for many different tasks.
It is only natural for us to turn to the Web to get news, to learn, entertain ourselves
and also communicate.
The book predicted the NOW we're living in, which is using the Web to pay the bills, 
manage finances and do business, do homework, enroll for online studies or courses...

This flow changed everything and moved the boundaries, with "the Web work-style"
and using digital tools and processes that enable organizations and individuals
to work smoothly.
For example, a project owner could go online and hire a team quickly, people who
are looking for work have more opportunities for employment that meets their
interests and needs.

Essay

### Discuss pros and cons of any young person who has achieved fame and success in a technological field whilst still at school.


In this day and age where a single good idea can bring fortune and success to an individual it is not unexpected for that to happen to someone who is still in for example high-school. A young person's mind is a very fragile thing. Sudden exposure to such unfolding of events where a young person can have different effects on said persons character. Increased wealth can provide access to before unavailable temptations some of which might be very negative on the person. First thing alongside maybe drugs might be all the riches that person can acquire for him/herself and therefore become greedy. On the other hand sudden success might cause envy and disruption in persons social relations in for example said school. Teachers might have different impression of the person all of a sudden. Regardless of that if the path towards that hypothetical success was hard and demanded a lot of effort, persons personality might've grown more rapidly that it is expected to grow for its given age. Such turn of events would leave the person more mature and much more experienced than its peers which is in my opinion not a bad thing. All fame and success is a very precarious double-edged sword and should be handled carefully.
