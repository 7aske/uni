Nikola
Tasić
Hi, my name is Nikola. I’m a
nerd and an aspiring software
engineer specializing in the
development of web systems.
Among the wide spectrum of my
interests, I would emphasize
backend web development, devops, Linux systems and clean
reusable architectures. I base
my knowledge off of late Richard
Feynman’s quote ‘‘What I cannot
create, I do not understand.’’
which can be observed on my
github/website. Also, Robert C.
Martin had an enormous influence
on me with his book Clean Code
which felt eye-opening and
relatable on numerous levels. I
think I am honest, enthusiastic,
easy to work with, more than
eager to learn more and also
willing to think outside the box
to solve any problem. Also, I am
a big advocate for open-source
software. Besides programming,
I’m interested in space
exploration and documentary
photography.
