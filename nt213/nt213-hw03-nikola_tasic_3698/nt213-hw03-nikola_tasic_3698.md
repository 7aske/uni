### Design

Website in question is a very simple minimalistic personal blog. The site itself is pretty vintage-looking and bare-bones which makes it really light and it loads very fast on pretty much any connection. Compared to modern websites it lacks a lot of the flashy pictures and artworks we are all used to see but that is exactly why I like it - it does one thing and one thing well. Design revolves around the 'C' programming language and the references to it can be found in the footer and the left-side navigation. Color scheme is black with a very  questionable choice of that pink color for the accents.

### Navigation

Navigation of the website is pretty simple. Firstly you navigate yourself to left side where you can find the menu. Secondly you select the desired blog post. And lastly you read the post. Simple? No dialog boxes, no ads, no other irrelevant information just the stuff you were looking for.

### Conclusion

This website offered a really simple and elegant solution to the problem of presenting your own work. I've found it scrolling randomly through Reddit and after I've seen it for the first time its simplicity really made it stick close to my heart.
