					<h2>About the company</h2>
					<h3>Tesla’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.</h3>
					<p>
						Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to compromise to drive
						electric – that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, Tesla
						builds not only all-electric vehicles but also infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products.
						Tesla believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards a zero-emission future, the
						better.
					</p>
					<p>
						Launched in 2008, the Roadster unveiled Tesla’s cutting-edge battery technology and electric powertrain. From there,
						Tesla designed the world’s first ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up – Model S – which has become the
						best car in its class in every category. Combining safety, performance, and efficiency, Model S has reset the
						world’s expectations for the car of the 21st century with the longest range of any electric vehicle, over-the-air
						software updates that make it better over time, and a record 0-60 mph acceleration time of 2.28 seconds as measured
						by Motor Trend. In 2015, Tesla expanded its product line with Model X, the safest, quickest and most capable sport
						utility vehicle in history that holds 5-star safety ratings across every category from the National Highway Traffic
						Safety Administration. Completing CEO Elon Musk’s “Secret Master Plan,” in 2016, Tesla introduced Model 3, a
						low-priced, high-volume electric vehicle that began production in 2017. Soon after, Tesla unveiled the safest, most
						comfortable truck ever – Tesla Semi – which is designed to save owners at least $200,000 over a million miles based
						on fuel costs alone.
					</p>
					<p>
						And this is just the beginning. With Tesla building its most affordable car yet, Tesla continues to make products
						accessible and affordable to more and more people, ultimately accelerating the advent of clean transport and clean
						energy production. Electric cars, batteries, and renewable energy generation and storage already exist
						independently, but when combined, they become even more powerful – that’s the future we want.
