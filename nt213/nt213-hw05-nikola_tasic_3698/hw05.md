## Cover letter

Hello Microsoft recruiter,

I’ve used Microsoft's products(not really) for as long as I’ve been a developer, and I recently came across a post about the architecture of your products on John Smiths’s blog. It made me think, “I really want (I don't) to work with these people who care so much(they don't actually) about what they do.” I’m super excited to hear about all the tools you have built(there are some that are okay) to make developer processes more streamlined; that’s right up my alley.

At my current job I started out as a web developer, but I was constantly blocked by broken builds and the multi-step process for getting code out to production. I took it upon myself to fix this by prototyping a continuous integration system that eventually turned into the system our team still uses today. As we’ve started to grow, I’m focusing a lot more of my time on monitoring systems and currently evaluating some possible solutions.

I look forward to hearing from you soon,

Nick Tasic
